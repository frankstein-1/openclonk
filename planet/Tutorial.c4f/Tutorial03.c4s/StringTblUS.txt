MsgIntro0=Welcome to the firing range. Here, you'll learn the basics of ranged combat.
MsgIntro1=Firstly, we'll use the javelin. Go pick that up now.
MsgJavelin0=Throw a javelin at the target. Keep the mouse button held down to ready it for throwing.
MsgJavelin1=Good job! Notice that you can collect three javelins in a stack for speedy throwing.
MsgJavelin2=This target is too high to hit normally. Try throwing while jumping.
MsgJavelin3=The target on the left is normally too far away. By throwing while running, your javelin can be thrown a much greater distance.
MsgBow0=Now we'll use the bow. Go to the next checkpoint to collect it.
MsgBow1=The bow is handled much like the javelin, except you do not need to run and jump to shoot the farthest. This allows for greater accuracy, but less stopping power.
MsgBow2=Out of arrows? Collect some from the chest beside the Bow.
