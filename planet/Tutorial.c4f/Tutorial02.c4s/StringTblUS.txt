MsgTutWelcome=Welcome to the second tutorial. In this tutorial you have two clonks at your disposal, and your goal will be to reach the flag on the far right side with both clonks. At any time you can click on the guide for helpful hints.
MsgTutGrappleUp=The clonk is not able to jump that high, you can use the grapple bow. Shoot the hook into the rock at the indicated position. You can use [Up] and [Down] to climb the rope, and [Left] and [Right] to swing back and forth.
MsgTutCrewSelection=There is nothing else you can do with this clonk for the moment. To select another crew member you can either click on the clonk you want to control in the upper left part of the HUD, or by pressing [Shift] + the number key corresponding to the clonk.
MsgTutBlowUpGold=It seems like miners left behind a wired detonator in this gold mine. Collect it and press [Use] to blow up the gold blocking your way out.
MsgTutFreeOtherClonk=Now that this clonk is free, look for a way to free your other clonk. Note that your clonk can interact with many objects, most of them vehicles and buildings. You can interact with them by standing in front of them and pressing [Interact] (Space bar), also for every interactable a clickable icon will appear in the HUD.
MsgTutCannon=Ah you found the cannon, the cannon can be used to fire objects over great distances. It needs gunpowder, contained in a powder keg, to operate. To fire an object with the cannon click in the landscape to aim the cannon, left click will shoot your left-hand item, right click your right-hand item.
MsgTutFindExplosives=You need to blast through the rock over there to free your other clonk. Look for some explosives, firestones in this case, near the gold mine.
MsgTutExplosivesChest=The miners left some explosives in this chest. Open it with [Interact], the chest's contents will then appear. Click the with left or right mouse button on an item to swap/collect it. By clicking the left or right mouse button, the item from the chest will be swapped with whatever is in your primary or secondary hand.
MsgTutGrappleSwing=Now select your other clonk and move to the edge indicated by the arrow. Jump from there and shoot with the grappler to the granite ceiling, the other arrow. Then use [Left] and [Right] to swing across the cliff.
MsgTutRopeladder=Well done! You can now use your ropeladder to help your friend up this ledge. Move to the arrow and release the ropeladder by clicking to the left of your clonk. Ropeladders can be climbed just as normal walls.
MsgTutDive=To make it past the next obstacle you would need to dive. Clonks have limited breath, so you need to resurface regularly. You can resurface at the locations indicated by the arrows. In the chests under the lake explosives can be found, these are crucial for completing the tutorial.
MsgTutBlastGranite=Use the explosives, which can be found under the lake, to blast through the granite. The best location is indicated by the arrow.
MsgTutBlastedGranite=Good job, for the last hurdle you need some grapple bows. Two per clonk to be precise, these can be found a tunnel a little back.
MsgTutLastGrapple=Ouch, that looks like an acid lake. No chance swimming across here, the easiest way over is by alternate use of two grapple bows. Shoot the first hook into the granite, then while scaling the rope use the second grappler, repeat this till you crossed the acid lake.

MsgTutBackpack=As you might have learned the clonk can hold two items in its hands, however it can carry more by using a backpack. The backpack can be opened and closed with Q, when the backpack is opened you can interchange one of your hand items with a backpack item by left or right clicking on that respective item.
