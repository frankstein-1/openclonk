#Intro: Clonk selection
MsgTutWelcome=Welcome to the second tutorial. Your goal will be to reach the gold plateau on the far right side with both your clonks.
MsgTutClonks=In this tutorial you have two clonks, the clonk you are currently controlling can not do a lot since it is trapped.
MsgTutSelection=For a starter let's shift between clonks, this is done by pressing Shift + the number key corresponding to the clonk you want to select. In this case press \"Shift + 2\".

#Part two: chest backpack control.
MsgTut04=Well done! With this clonk you must find a way to get up to the second clonk. You need to blast the rock covering the cave entrance.
MsgTut05=Let's first not worry about getting up there. Hey there is catapult(invisible) and a chest.
MsgTut06=TODO: script/explain chest put and get.
MsgTut07=TODO: script/texture/explain catapult.
MsgTut08=Nice job, you blasted the rock covering the entrance into the cave. But without the help of the second clonk you can't get your first one up there.
MsgTut09=Select your second clonk. By now you must know how to do that.

#Part Z: Blast rock


#Part Y: Ropeladder
MsgTutRockBlasted=Nice job, you blasted the rock covering the entrance into the cave. But without the help of the second clonk you can't get your first one up there.
MsgTutSelectOther=Select your second clonk. By now you must know how to do that.

MsgTutRopeladder=Grab a ropeladder from the chest. Go to the location indicated by the arrow.
MsgTutUnfold=Move slowly to the edge of the cliff. You can use the ropeladder by clicking in the landscape. Use the left mousebutton if you are holding the ladder in your left hand or the right button otherwise. Click to the left of your clonk to roll the ropeladder over the edge of the cliff

#Part XX: Dynamite Box
MsgTutUpwards=Ah good, your other clonk can get into the cave. There seems to be some blasting work ahead so don't forget to grab some dynamite from the chest. Move your clonk with some dynamite to the rock indicated by the arrow.
MsgTutBroughtDyna=Ok you've brought the dynamite. You can place up to five dynamite sticks into the landscape, this is done by pressing the mousebutton somewhere near the clonk. 
MsgTutPlaceDyna=In order to blow up the rock place five dynamite sticks around the position indicated by the arrow. Do not click again after that!
MsgTutDetonate=Ok now you've placed the five dynamite sticks, move away a little, and then press the mousebutton again to detonate the dynamite.
MsgTutSmokeCleared=Now that the smoke has cleared walk with your clonk to the arrow, new instructions are awaiting you there.
