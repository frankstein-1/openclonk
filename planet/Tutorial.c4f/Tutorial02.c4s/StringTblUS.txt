MsgTutWelcome=Welcome to the second tutorial. Your goal will be to reach the gold plateau on the far right side with both your clonks. First make yourself familiar with the landscape and try to figure out a way to get there. At any time you can click on the professor for helpful hints. Close this window by clicking on the red cross.
MsgTutCrewSelection=Since you have two clonks and can only control one clonk at a time, it might be useful to switch between clonks. You can either click on the clonk you want to control in the upperleft part of the HUD, or by pressing Shift + the number key corresponding to the clonk.
MsgTutBackpack=One of your clonks has a shovel in its backpack. The backpack can be opened and closed with Q, when the backpack is opened you can interchange one of your hand items with a backpack item by left or right clicking on that respective item. With the use of the shovel find the abandoned mine.
MsgTutLorry=Some mining equipment may have been left behind in the lorry, grab it!
MsgTutRopeladder=Your second clonk has some rope ladders, these are very useful in aiding other clonks to overcome obstacles in the landscape. When using the rope ladder the ladder will be unrolled towards the location of the click.
MsgTutDynamiteBox=The dynamitebox can be used to blast through large amounts of material. When using the dynamite box you can stick 5 dynamite pieces into some material, the sixth time you click you will detonate the dynamite. Before doing that you really want to be somehwere distant.
MsgTutGrappleBow=The last hurdle, a dangerous cliff to get over. With the grapple bow your can shoot a hook with attached rope, the clonk will hang onto the rope. Using two grapple bows swing across the pit by shooting hooks to the sky islands continuously.
