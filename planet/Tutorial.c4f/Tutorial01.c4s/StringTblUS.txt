GuideMsgMovement=Clonks are controlled with the WASD keys. Press 'A' or 'D' to make the clonk walk left or right. Pressing 'W' will make the clonk jump.
GuideMsgScale=Here you will need to scale the wall to advance. To scale, walk towards the wall until your clonk grabs on. Once you have grabbed on, you may scale up or down the wall by holding 'W' or 'S'.
GuideMsgHangle=To hangle, jump towards the roof. When your clonk grabs on, you will be able to move left or right. To release, press 'S'.
GuideMsgSwim=Swimming is controlled simply by pressing in the direction you wish your clonk to move. While underwater make certain you resurface before your breath runs out, otherwise you will drown!
GuideMsgDig=You'll need a shovel to dig through here. What's that under the water?
GuideMsgTools=The shovel is now shown in your clonk's inventory on the lower left of the screen. You can use it with the left mouse button if it is in your left hand and with the right mouse button if it is in your right hand. || Right click on the shovel in your inventory slot to get a brief description on how it works.
GuideMsgChest=You'll need to make a loam bridge to cross this obstacle. In the chest there is a chunk of loam. Go in front of the chest and press 'SPACE' to open the chest. Once the chest's contents appear, you can click the left or right mouse button to collect items into your inventory. ||By clicking the left or right mouse button, the item from the chest will be swapped with whatever is in that hand.
GuideMsgLoam=Hold down the mouse button to build a loam bridge. Building a loam bridge works like digging with the shovel, only that you don't dig a tunnel but build a bridge out of loam.
GuideMsgFlint=Oh, what's this? The cave's exit has been blocked with solid rock. You can't dig through solid rock with the shovel. Collect firestones from the chest to blow a hole in the wall (throw with mouse click). To collect both, you'll want to put your shovel into your backpack. ||To access your backpack, press 'Q'. From this menu, you can store, swap, or collect items from the backpack.
