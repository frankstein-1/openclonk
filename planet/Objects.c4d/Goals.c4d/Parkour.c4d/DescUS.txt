In a parkour all players start at the same location, the so called start. In their way to the finish, they have to pass through multiple checkpoints. Checkpoints can have different properties, sometimes they allow you to respawn there. Other checkpoints must be passed in a specific order. The first player or team to reach the finish checkpoint, while having passed all other checkpoints before, wins.
