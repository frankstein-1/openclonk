MsgTutWelcome=Welcome to the target practice. Use the javelin and the bow to hit the balloon targets and make your way to the flag on the far right side.
MsgTutJavelin=Retrieve the javelins from the chest and use them to hit the first few targets. Right click on the javelin in the HUD to get some hints on how to use it. 
MsgTutJumpThrow=If you have problems hitting targets with the javelin, throw it while jumping. That way you can throw the javelin a lot higher.
MsgTutBow=There is a bow in that chest. Some targets might not be reachable by throwing javelins, use the bow instead.
MsgTutHighBalloon=That balloon up high is hit more easily when shooting while jumping. Aim the bow first by holding [Use], then jump and release [Use] during the jump.
